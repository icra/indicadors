            "abstract" : "Wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) offers an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating among the population thereby serving as a proper surveillance method. The variant of concern (VOC) Alpha was first identified in September 2020 in the United Kingdom, and rapidly became dominant across Europe. Our objective was to elucidate the Alpha VOC outcompetition rate and identify mutations in the spike glycoprotein (S) gene, indicative of the circulation of the Alpha VOC and/or other variants in the population through wastewater analysis. In the period covered by this study (November 2020-April 2021), forteen wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were weekly sampled. The total number of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies per L (GC/L) was determined with a Real-Time qPCR, targeting the N gene. Surveillance of the Alpha VOC circulation was ascertained using a duplex RT-qPCR, targeting and discriminating the S gene. Our results showed that in a period of 6 weeks the Alpha VOC was present in all the studied WWTPs, and became dominant in 11 weeks on average. The outcompetition rates of the Alpha VOC were estimated, and their relationship with different parameters statistically analyzed. The rapid spread of the Alpha VOC was influenced by its initial input and by the previous circulation of SARS-COV-2 in the population. This latter point could be explained by its higher transmissibility, particularly advantadgeous when a certain degree of herd immunity exists. Moreover, the presence of signature mutations of SARS-COV-2 variants were established by deep-sequencing of the complete S gene. The circulation of the Alpha VOC in the area under study was confirmed, and additionally two combinations of mutations in the S glycoprotein (T73A and D253N, and S477N and A522S) that could affect antibody binding were identified.",

            "abstract" : "A metagenomics approach was applied to explore the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in bacteriophages from hospital wastewater. Metagenomic analysis showed that most phage sequences affiliated to the order Caudovirales, comprising the tailed phage families Podoviridae, Siphoviridae and Myoviridae. Moreover, the relative abundance of ARGs in the phage DNA fraction (0.26%) was higher than in the bacterial DNA fraction (0.18%). These differences were particularly evident for genes encoding ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) proteins, phosphotransferases, β-lactamases and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance. Analysis of assembled contigs also revealed that blaOXA-10, blaOXA-58 and blaOXA-24 genes belonging to class D β-lactamases as well as a novel blaTEM (98.9% sequence similarity to the blaTEM-1 gene) belonging to class A β-lactamases were detected in a higher proportion in phage DNA. Although preliminary, these findings corroborate the role of bacteriophages as reservoirs of resistance genes and thus highlight the necessity to include them in future studies on the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment.",

The genes were quantified in both particle-attached (PAB) and free-living (FLB) bacteria. Our results showed that absolute abundances were the highest in H waters. Although absolute abundances were significantly reduced in WWTP effluents, the relative abundance (normalized per 16S rRNA) was never lowered through wastewater treatment. Particularly, for the PAB the relative abundances were significantly higher in the effluents respect to the influents of both WWTPs for all the genes. The absolute abundances along the Zenne River increased from upstream to downstream, peaking after the release of WWTPs effluents, in both fractions. Our results demonstrated that bla, bla and bla are widely distributed in the Zenne as a consequence of chronic discharge from WWTPs. To conclude, the levels of carbapenemases genes are significantly lower than other genes conferring resistance to more widely used antibiotics (analyzed in previous studies carried out at the same sites), but could raise up to the levels of high prevalent resistance genes.",

To face this problem both at local and global scales, a better understanding of the sources and mechanisms that contribute to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance is required. Recent studies demonstrate that aquatic ecosystems are reservoirs of resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes as well as potential conduits for their transmission to human pathogens. Despite the wealth of information about antibiotic pollution and its effect on the aquatic microbial resistome, the contribution of environmental biofilms to the acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance has not been fully explored in aquatic systems. Biofilms are structured multicellular communities embedded in a self-produced extracellular matrix that acts as a barrier to antibiotic diffusion. High population densities and proximity of cells in biofilms also increases the chances for genetic exchange among bacterial species converting biofilms in hot spots of antibiotic resistance. This review focuses on the potential effect of antibiotic pollution on biofilm microbial communities, with special emphasis on ecological and evolutionary processes underlying acquired resistance to these compounds.",

            "abstract" : "Wastewater based epidemiology was employed to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within the sewershed areas of 10 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Catalonia, Spain. A total of 185 WWTPs inflow samples were collected over the period consisting of both the first wave (mid-March to June) and the second wave (July to November). Concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (N1 and N2 assays) were quantified in these wastewaters as well as those of Human adenoviruses (HAdV) and JC polyomavirus (JCPyV), as indicators of human faecal contamination. SARS-CoV-2 N gene daily loads strongly correlated with the number of cases diagnosed one week after sampling i.e. wastewater levels were a good predictor of cases to be diagnosed in the immediate future. The conditions present at small WWTPs relative to larger WWTPs influence the ability to follow the pandemic. Small WWTPs (<24,000 inhabitants) had lower median loads of SARS-CoV-2 despite similar incidence of infection within the municipalities served by the different WWTP (but not lower loads of HAdV and JCPyV). The lowest incidence resulting in quantifiable SARS-CoV-2 concentration in wastewater differed between WWTP sizes, being 0.11 and 0.82 cases/1000 inhabitants for the large and small sized WWTP respectively.",

In small streams and rivers, local inputs of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) may become important sources of organic matter, nutrients and emerging pollutants, such as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In this study, we evaluated the effect of WWTP effluents as a source of ARGs in river biofilms. The prevalence of genes conferring resistance to main antibiotic families, such as beta-lactams (blaCTX-M), fluoroquinolones (qnrS), sulfonamides (sul I), and macrolides (ermB), was determined using quantitative PCR (qPCR) in biofilm samples collected upstream and downstream WWTPs discharge points in four low-order streams. Our results showed that the WWTP effluents strongly modified the hydrology, physico-chemistry and biological characteristics of the receiving streams and favoured the persistence and spread of antibiotic resistance in microbial benthic communities. It was also shown that the magnitude of effects depended on the relative contribution of each WWTP to the receiving system. Specifically, low concentrations of ARGs were detected at sites located upstream of the WWTPs, while a significant increase of their concentrations was observed in biofilms collected downstream of the WWTP discharge points (particularly ermB and sul I genes). These findings suggest that WWTP discharges may favour the increase and spread of antibiotic resistance among streambed biofilms. The present study also showed that the presence of ARGs in biofilms was noticeable far downstream of the WWTP discharge (up to 1 km). It is therefore reasonable to assume that biofilms may represent an ideal setting for the acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance determinants and thus be considered suitable biological indicators of anthropogenic pollution by active pharmaceutical compounds.",

            "abstract" : "Migratory birds may have a vital role in the spread of antimicrobial resistance across habitats and regions, but empirical data remain scarce. We investigated differences in the gut microbiome composition and the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in faeces from four migratory waterbirds wintering in South-West Spain that differ in their habitat use. The white stork Ciconia ciconia and lesser black-backed gull Larus fuscus are omnivorous and opportunistic birds that use highly anthropogenic habitats such as landfills and urban areas. The greylag goose Anser anser and common crane Grus grus are herbivores and use more natural habitats. Fresh faeces from 15 individuals of each species were analysed to assess the composition of bacterial communities using 16S rRNA amplicon-targeted sequencing, and to quantify the abundance of the Class I integron integrase gene (intI1) as well as genes encoding resistance to sulfonamides (sul1), beta-lactams (bla, bla and bla), tetracyclines (tetW), fluoroquinolones (qnrS), and colistin (mcr-1) using qPCR. Bacterial communities in gull faeces were the richest and most diverse. Beta diversity analysis showed segregation in faecal communities between bird species, but those from storks and gulls were the most similar, these being the species that regularly feed in landfills. Potential bacterial pathogens identified in faeces differed significantly between bird species, with higher relative abundance in gulls. Faeces from birds that feed in landfills (stork and gull) contained a significantly higher abundance of ARGs (sul1, bla, and tetW). Genes conferring resistance to last resort antibiotics such as carbapenems (bla) and colistin (mcr-1) were only observed in faeces from gulls. These results show that these bird species are reservoirs of antimicrobial resistant bacteria and suggest that waterbirds may disseminate antibiotic resistance across environments (e.g., from landfills to ricefields or water supplies), and thus constitute a risk for their further spread to wildlife and humans.",

            "abstract" : "Antibiotic resistance has become a major health concern; thus, there is a growing interest in exploring the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment as well as the factors that contribute to their emergence. Aquatic ecosystems provide an ideal setting for the acquisition and spread of ARGs due to the continuous pollution by antimicrobial compounds derived from anthropogenic activities. We investigated, therefore, the pollution level of a broad range of antibiotics and ARGs released from hospital and urban wastewaters, their removal through a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and their presence in the receiving river. Several antimicrobial compounds were detected in all water samples collected. Among antibiotic families, fluoroquinolones were detected at the highest concentration, especially in hospital effluent samples. Although good removal efficiency by treatment processes was observed for several antimicrobial compounds, most antibiotics were still present in WWTP effluents. The results also revealed that copy numbers of ARGs, such as blaTEM (resistance to β-lactams), qnrS (reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones), ermB (resistance to macrolides), sulI (resistance to sulfonamides) and tetW (resistance to tetracyclines), were detected at the highest concentrations in hospital effluent and WWTP influent samples. Although there was a significant reduction in copy numbers of these ARGs in WWTP effluent samples, this reduction was not uniform across analyzed ARGs. Relative concentration of ermB and tetW genes decreased as a result of wastewater treatment, whereas increased in the case of blaTEM, sulI and qnrS genes. The incomplete removal of antibiotics and ARGs in WWTP severely affected the receiving river, where both types of emerging pollutants were found at higher concentration in downstream waters than in samples collected upstream from the discharge point. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a widespread occurrence of antibiotics and ARGs in urban and hospital wastewater and how these effluents, even after treatment, contribute to the spread of these emerging pollutants in the aquatic environment.",

The challenge comes when this approach is employed to help Health authorities in their decision-making. Here, we describe the roadmap for the design and deployment of SARSAIGUA, the Catalan Surveillance Network of SARS-CoV-2 in Sewage. The network monitors, weekly or biweekly, 56 WWTPs evenly distributed across the territory and serving 6 M inhabitants (80% of the Catalan population). Each week, samples from 45 WWTPs are collected, analyzed, results reported to Health authorities, and finally published within less than 72 h in an online dashboard ( https://sarsaigua.icra.cat ). After 20 months of monitoring (July 20-March 22), the standardized viral load (gene copies/day) in all the WWTPs monitored fairly matched the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases along the successive pandemic waves, showing a good fit with the diagnosed cases in the served municipalities (Spearman Rho = 0.69). Here we describe the roadmap of the design and deployment of SARSAIGUA while providing several open-access tools for the management and visualization of the surveillance data.",

            "abstract" : "Quantitative measurements of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in raw wastewater have been implemented worldwide since the beginning of the pandemic. Recent efforts are being made to evaluate different viral concentration methodologies to overcome supplier shortages during lockdowns. A set of 22-wastewater samples seeded with murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, and the bacteriophage MS2, were used to characterize and compare two ultrafiltration-based methods: a centrifugal ultrafiltration device (Centricon® Plus-70) and the automated concentrating pipette CP-Select™. Based on the recovery efficiencies, significant differences were observed for MHV, with Centricon® Plus-70 (24%) being the most efficient method. Nevertheless, concentrations of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2, Human adenoviruses and JC polyomaviruses in these samples did not result in significant differences between methods suggesting that testing naturally occurring viruses may complement the evaluation of viral concentration methodologies. Based on the virus adsorption to solids and the necessity of a pre-centrifugation step to remove larger particles and avoid clogging when using ultrafiltration methods, we assessed the percentage of viruses not quantified after ultrafiltration. Around 23% of the detected SARS-CoV-2 would be discarded during the debris removal step. The CP-Select™ provided the highest concentration factor (up to 333×) and the lowest LoD (6.19 × 10 GC/l) for MHV and proved to be fast, automatic, highly reproducible and suitable to work under BSL-2 measures.",

            "abstract" : "Bacteriophages (phages) are the most abundant and diverse biological entities in our planet. They infect susceptible bacterial hosts into which they either multiply or persist. In the latter case, phages can confer new functions to their hosts as a result of gene transfer, thus contributing to their adaptation (short-term) and evolution (long-term). In this regard, the role of phages on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among bacterial hosts in natural environments has not yet been clearly resolved. Here, we carry out a comprehensive analysis of thirty-three viromes from different habitats to investigate whether phages harbor ARGs. Our results demonstrate that while human-associated viromes do not or rarely carry ARGs, viromes from non-human sources (e.g. pig feces, raw sewage, and freshwater and marine environments) contain a large reservoir of ARGs, thus pointing out that phages could play a part on the spread of antibiotic resistance. Given this, the role of phages should not be underestimated and it should be considered when designing strategies to tackle the global crisis of antibiotic resistance.",

The plant relies on several technologies, including: anaerobic digestion (AD), solid-liquid separation, and two stages reverse osmosis (RO) of the liquid digestate. Tetracycline, fluoroquinolone, lincosamide and pleuromutilin antibiotics, together with anti-helmintic (flubendazole) and anti-inflammatory (flunixin) drugs were the most frequently detected compounds in livestock waste and in slaughterhouse sludge. This last fraction is used as co-substrate in the AD process and showed to be an important input source of PhACs and ARGs. In terms of treatment performance, AD exhibited moderate to low PhACs and ARGs reduction, while a large fraction (<50%) of the PhACs present in the digestate were distributed onto the solid fraction, after solid-liquid separation. Both solid and liquid digestates had relatively high copy numbers of ARGs. Finally, RO showed high rejection percentages for all PhACs (<90%), with concentrations in the low ng L range in permeates, for most target PhACs. Nevertheless, moderate copy numbers of ARGs were detected in permeates.",

Cependant, l'urbanisation et l'agriculture font pression sur les richesses naturelles du pays. Depuis 2000, le Canada a progressé dans le découplage de la croissance économique par rapport à la pollution de l'air, la consommation d'énergie et les émissions de gaz à effet de serre, mais il demeure l'une des économies à plus haute intensité d'énergie et d'émissions de l'OCDE. De plus amples efforts sont nécessaires pour passer à une économie verte, à bas carbone.Ce rapport est le troisième examen environnemental du Canada. Il évalue ses progrès en matière de développement durable et de croissance verte, avec des chapitres détaillés sur le changement climatique et le traitement des eaux usées urbaines.",

            "snippet" : "In the context of the REFIT evaluation of the UWWTD, this report contributes to addressing the following evaluation questions: •\tTo what extent have the objectives of the UWWTD been achieved?•\tTo what extent are the main pollutants released by urban areas collected and treated?•\tWhat have been the (quantitative and qualitative) effects of the UWWTD?•\tTo what extent is the UWWTD still relevant to achieve its objectives of protection of the environment from the adverse effects of waste water discharges? •\tWhat would be the most likely consequences of stopping or withdrawing the existing EU intervention?This study quantifies the reduction of nutrients and organic matter in European waters as a consequence of the implementation of the UWWTD. To this end, we first calculate loads and concentrations of organic matter, measured as 5-days Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5), total nitrogen (N), and total phosphorus (P) in different scenarios representative of the past (before entry into force of the Directive), present and future under assumptions of a full implementation of the Directive. BOD5, N and P are, together with total suspended solids (TSS), specific targets for urban wastewater treatment. In addition, we estimate concentrations of indicator coliforms in European rivers and coastal areas. Coliforms are not a target of the UWWTD, but they are directly relevant for the quality of bathing waters. Finally, we estimate the reduction of loads of selected micropollutants achieved through implementation of the UWWTD. Micropollutants are also not a target of the UWWTD, but their environmental fate and transport may be very significantly affected by the wastewater treatment system, as many of them are emitted primarily in urban areas and pass through wastewater treatment plants. Quantifying absolute values of the loads of micropollutants in Europe has proven to be a daunting task, far from being achieved even for a limited set of priority substances. However, based on the properties of the substances it is possible to quantify the percentage of the micropollutants entering the wastewater treatment system, which are eventually released in the environment.",

With this aim, the analysis goes beyond the analysis of impacts of regulation on innovation to highlight links between innovation and the broader context in which it occurs. Ultimately, this aims to provide a systematic approach for those engaged in planning and implementing impact assessments, to raise awareness and provide examples of how innovation impacts can be factored in impact assessments of legislation.

The external surplus is comfortable, and the public debt-to-GDP ratio, already well below the OECD average, is still falling. However, Israeli society remains marked by weak social cohesion and significant disparities, which penalise parts of the population and threaten the longer-term sustainability of these good results. Despite better employment outcomes among Israeli-Arabs and the Haredim, workers from these communities are often trapped in low-paid jobs due to their weak skill sets, implying persistent poverty and weak aggregate productivity. Moreover, low social transfers imply that the often large families in these communities face deprivation that contributes to child poverty. High cost of living and house prices also weigh on the social situation and well-being, and public transport deficiencies are detrimental to work-life balance and cause urban congestion and poor ...",

For each scenario, we analyse the possible implications for key water management issues (wastewater treatment, diffuse pollution and hydromorphological alteration). Based on this analysis, we identify possible no-regret actions to adopt in the Danube region in order to improve water management in the long-term, along the three main lines: 1) Developing effective communities. 2) Basin-wide integration of the management of certain issues. 3) Bringing nature protection to the core of strategies. Sharing and strengthening capacity at various levels of water management is a precondition to avoid marginalization and impoverishment of regions within the Danube. Education of the youth in schools and universities (including through student exchanges and harmonization of educational programmes) is essential to ...",

The pandemic acted as a magnifying glass on pressing water and sanitation challenges in Asia-Pacific countries, stressing and widening inequalities for 30 to 40% of households that do not have a dedicated place for washing hands with soap and water on premises. This report uses the OECD Principles on Water Governance as an assessment framework to provide a regional analysis of the state of play of water governance in 48 countries of the Asia – Pacific region. It maps the existence and level of implementation of key governance frameworks, institutions and mechanisms, and dives into select governance gaps before drawing preliminary observations on the extent to which effective water governance correlates with tangible water security outcomes in surveyed countries.",

During that update, the Commission concluded that the substances diclofenac, oxadiazon, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, tri-allate and 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate should be removed from the WL, while the insecticide metaflumizone and the antibiotics amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin should be included (EU 2018/840). The period of continuous monitoring for any WL substance should not exceed four years (Article 8b in Directive 2008/105/EC as amended by Directive 2013/39/EU). Thus, by the end of the 4th reporting year for the WL (2019) the substances in the 1st WL should have been removed and a maximum of 12 substances or groups of substances may be listed in the 3rd WL.

The SSD aims at encouraging and ensuring the correct use of sewage sludge in agriculture. It regulates sludge use with an objective of preventing harmful effect on soil, waters, vegetation, animals, and humans. The main objective of the Directive is the protection of environment and human health. The Directive prohibits the use of untreated sludge on agricultural land unless it is injected or incorporated into the soil, it also requires that sludge is used in such a way that the nutrient requirements of plants and that the quality of the soil and of surface and groundwater is not impaired. In the past 34 years, there have been changes on the understanding of sewage sludge, the risks, and opportunities its use presents, but also in the wider environmental legislative framework that justify an in-depth evaluation of the Directive.",

            "snippet" : "Greece has undergone extensive reforms to cope with a deep recession over the past decade. It has made progress in decoupling air pollutant emissions from GDP and improving the conservation status of natural habitats. However, the country faces challenges in managing waste and water, and addressing air pollution. It is highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. The energy mix has shifted towards cleaner fuels, but the economy strongly relies on fossil fuels. Progress towards sustainable development requires effective implementation of ambitious climate mitigation and adaptation policies, strengthening environmental governance and enhancing coherence between environmental and energy, transport, agriculture and tourism policies.This is the third Environmental Performance Review of Greece. It evaluates progress towards sustainable development and green growth, with special features on climate change mitigation and adaptation, and biodiversity conservation and sustainable use.",

The aim of the report is to present the analysis of the effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, relevance and EU-added value of the UWWTD. The UWWTD is a relatively old instrument (adopted in 1991) that has previously not been subject to a stand-alone Evaluation. In the past 30 years there have been changes in the understanding of pressures on waterbodies, new pressures on the environment but also technical progress. Furthermore, there have been changes to the legal framework in the EU since its entry into force, for instance with the adoption of the Wate...",

The results from the first year of monitoring the substances of the 1st WL showed that some countries have found it very difficult to reach a satisfactory analytical limit of quantification (LOQ) for five out of the 17 substances (17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), 17-beta-estradiol (E2), azithromycin, imidacloprid, and methiocarb). The most difficult WL substance to analyse is EE2 with its very low EQS value of 0.035 ng/L. Five countries have reported for EE2 LOQs ≤ EQS, and other four countries a close LOQ (0.05 - 0.1 ng/L). However, the workshop participants (experts from Member States and Island, Switzerland and Turkey) stressed that the analysi...",

            "snippet" : "Knowledge of ecological and health risks of microplastic pollution is surrounded by considerable uncertainty. However, if microplastic pollution continues at the present rate, these risks will increase and, in particular, widespread ecological risks are likely in the coming decades. The absence of population-wide studies means that it is not yet possible to assess risks for human health. Ongoing and planned EU policy measures aim to reduce all plastic pollution including microplastics. But what more, if anything, should be done now as a precaution against future risks from microplastics? This scientific opinion, informed by a SAPEA evidence review report makes recommendations to advise debate, policy and practice in this and related areas. Highlights include calls to: • Broaden existing policy to prevent and reduce microplastic pollution in water, air, and soil; and to prioritise substance- and context-specific measures for high-volume, high-emission sources; • Ensure benefit to society of microplastic...",

With this aim, the analysis goes beyond the analysis of impacts of regulation on innovation to highlight links between innovation and the broader context in which it occurs. Ultimately, this aims to provide a systematic approach for those engaged in planning and implementing impact assessments, to raise awareness and provide examples of how innovation impacts can be factored in impact assessments of legislation. The guide is based on empirical analysis of existing impact assessments mainly at the EU-level. More than 30 impact assessments were screened and 15 analysed in greater detail including the Commission’s published impact assessments, support studies, and the Regulatory Scrutiny Board’s opinions.

It also includes new and innovative material to further strengthen its relevance as a reference document. In particular, the four thematic chapters each cover a targeted set of indicators for which data coverage is generally more consistent across time in OECD countries and that capture the main pressures agriculture exerts on the environment. The thematic chapters cover the following areas: the interlinked issues of land use, pesticides and farmland birds; ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions, the main air pollutants from agricultural activities; nitrogen and phosphorus balances, two indicators that signal air and water pollution; and water use and irrigation in agriculture.",

The results from the first year of monitoring the substances of the 1st WL showed that some countries have found it very difficult to reach a satisfactory analytical limit of quantification (LOQ) for five out of the 17 substances (17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), 17-beta-estradiol (E2), azithromycin, imidacloprid, and methiocarb). The most difficult WL substance to analyse is EE2 with its very low EQS value of 0.035 ng/L. Five countries have reported for EE2 LOQs ≤ EQS, and other four countries a close LOQ (0.05 - 0.1 ng/L).

The 2030 Agenda also requires a paradigm shift in governance, - at and between all levels. This study examines the governance frameworks put in place for SDG implementation in all EU Member States, and the resulting country fiches constitute the first comprehensive comparative overview of these. The study also provides an overview of the developments at EU level and has a special focus on the role of parliaments in implementing Agenda 2030. Our analysis shows that EU Member States are integrating SDGs into national strategies. While Member States have taken steps to enhance horizontal policy coordination, there is a continuing need for better mainstreaming sustainability. Member States innovate with SDG budgeting, science-policy interface, and stakeholder participation mechanisms for making these strategies more operational. Parliaments show increasing activity on the SDGs and ...",

The list was first updated in June 2018 by the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/840. The period of continuous monitoring for any WL substance should not exceed four years (Article 8b of the EQSD). Thus, in 2022 the three substances added in 2018, i.e. the insecticide metaflumizone and the antibiotics amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin, should be removed. A maximum total of thirteen substances or groups of substances may be listed in the 4th WL, i.e. one more than the maximum allowed in 2020. The six substances or groups of substances added during the third WL update (EU 2020/1161) should be carried over to the 4th WL to ensure that enough high-quality monitoring data are collected for their risk assessment.

However, urbanisation and agriculture are putting pressure on the natural asset base. Since 2000, Canada has made progress in decoupling economic growth from air pollution, energy consumption and GHG emissions, but it remains one of the most energy- and emissions-intensive economies in the OECD. Further progress is needed to transition to a green, low-carbon economy.This is the third Environmental Performance Review of Canada. It evaluates progress towards sustainable development and green growth, with special features on climate change mitigation and urban wastewater management.",

Not all potential contaminants/impurities or intentionally added substances of concern are indeed covered. In addition, the Fertilising Products Regulation does not cover fertilising products marketed under national rules. In case considered necessary to address certain identified risks for human health and/or the environment, the idea is to assess whether the REACH Regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals) could be used.

The framework is designed to evaluate the implementation, progress, and impact of these initiatives, integrating human, animal, and environmental health. It addresses varied legislative and non-legislative actions across the EU-27, Iceland, and Norway, providing a flexible and cost-effective system for monitoring AMR interventions. The framework&#39;s development followed a structured methodology, involving desk research, the creation of intervention logic (IL) for both the Action Plan and Council Recommendation, and extensive stakeholder consultations. Indicators were selected based on relevance, feasibility, and data availability, ensuring that they align with EU and Member State priorities.",

The analysis encompasses 154 quantifiable targets from 44 policy documents between 2019 and 2024 across key sectors such as climate, energy, circular economy, transport, agriculture and food, ecosystems and biodiversity, water, soil and air pollution.The study shows that significant achievement has been delivered so far but progress needs to accelerate in many areas. As of mid-2024, 32 of the 154 targets are currently “on track” and 64 are identified as “acceleration needed” meaning that more progress is needed to meet the targets on time. Furthermore, 15 of the targets are found to be “not progressing” or “regressing”, and for 43 of the targets no data is currently available. The timing of the binding policies, most of which have been recently agreed and are expected to deliver results in the coming years, ...",

To complete this ambitious goal, the CSS brings forward a set of initiatives aiming at contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Beyond the CSS, multiple other political commitments have been made to support the EU chemical industry and all downstream sectors in moving towards more sustainable growth.

With a rapidly growing global population, demand for water is expected to increase by nearly one-third by 2050. In the face of accelerated consumption, increasing environmental degradation and the multi-faceted impacts of climate change, we clearly need new ways to manage competing demands on our precious freshwater resources. The 2018 edition of the UN World Water Development Report (WWDR2018) suggests that solutions may be closer than we think. For too long, the world has turned first to human-built, or “grey”, infrastructure to improve water management.

The agricultural innovation and knowledge system could play a key role in addressing the environmental challenges and improving the sector’s resilience.Policies for the Future of Farming and Food in Spain undertakes a thorough examination of the Spanish agro-food sector. It applies the OECD Productivity, Sustainability and Resilience (PSR) analytical framework along with the latest data from the OECD Agri-Environmental Indicators to benchmark the country’s sustainable productivity performance and to identify the main challenges facing the sector. This report proposes a new policy approach, which puts innovation at the centre of a strategy to reconcile environmental performance and productivity growth. Its policy recommendations focus on actions to improve the agricultural knowledge and innovation system and make it more responsive to the most urgent environmental pressures....",

It assesses the current system’s implementation challenges and provides possible solutions. The report explores how water charges can be both an effective means for dealing with water security issues, and a tool for enhancing economic growth and social welfare. Specific analysis is put forward for three case studies in the State of Rio de Janiero, the Paraiba do Sul River Basin and the Piancó-Piranhas-Açu River Basin. The report highlights that water charges need to operate in conjunction with an effective water regulatory regime and concludes with an Action Plan based on practical steps and recommendations for its implementation in the short, medium and long-term.",

Policy solutions have been identified, but not always applied where needed nor implemented effectively. This report analyses eight past water and agriculture policy changes in OECD countries with the aim to identify steps towards adopting and implementing such solutions effectively. Selected reforms are assessed systematically via an institutional change analysis and a cross-cutting comparison of political economy factors. A characterisation of reforms is proposed according to the scope of the reform process, the scope of the reform’s action, and the involvement of governments in the design of reforms and their implementation. The comparison of agriculture and water policy changes shows that introducing reforms can be facilitated by exogenous factors, including droughts and floods, and reform design features. Meanwhile, the outcome of reforms can be affected by their geographical scale and scope, the dyna...",

Since 2008, its economic growth has been relatively decoupled from air emissions, energy use, waste generation and water consumption. However, the high resource intensity of Turkey’s economy and its heavy reliance on fossil fuels will continue to increase these environmental pressures in absolute terms. More progress is needed in the transition to a low-carbon, circular economy to improve the country’s environmental performance.This is the third Environmental Performance Review of Turkey. It evaluates progress towards sustainable development and green growth, with special features on climate change and urban wastewater management."

The analysis builds on results from a 2019 survey on agriculture and water policy changes which gathered responses from 38 countries – including OECD countries, Costa Rica, Colombia, and Cabo Verde – and the European Union. A methodology was developed to convert survey responses into indices of alignment of policy changes with OECD and G20 recommendations. Results show that changes in water and agriculture policies from 2009 to 2019 were uneven across countries and investigated policy areas (water governance, water quality, water quantity and water risks), with some countries undertaking important reforms whereas others mainly improved existing policies. On average, alignment indices suggest that agriculture and water policies in res...",

In the context of the European Green Deal and the COVID-19 pandemic, the topic is now even more relevant (see also Chapter 2). The EU Strategic Approach to PiE received strong backing from Council and Parliament, as well as from stakeholders. Complementary to the Pharmaceutical Strategy, which also includes an environmental sustainability angle, it is time to reflect on what has been so far achieved in implementing the March 2019 EU Strategic Approach to PiE. In June 2019, the Environment Council discussed the issue of pharmaceuticals in the environment, concluding that concrete and ambitious actions are necessary to reduce the risk from pharmaceuticals and their residues to the environment and...",

It then focuses on two sources of microplastics pollution, textile products and vehicle tyres, due to their substantial contribution to global microplastics emissions and currently largely absent policy frameworks to mitigate them.Several best practices and technological solutions can be implemented along the lifecycle of textile products and vehicle tyres to mitigate releases to the environment. The report proposes policy insights on measures and strategies that could help minimise microplastics emitted unintentionally from products and their potential impacts on human health and ecosystems.",

            "snippet" : "Measuring policy progress on agriculture and water policies is essential to help decision makers identify necessary policy changes and understand how further progress may be achieved to improve agricultural water management. A thorough review of existing evaluations of agriculture and water policies suggests three types of progress to be measured: policy design, policy implementation capacity and policy results. The quality and robustness of these measures of policy progress depends upon three main factors. First, assessment of policy design requires matching policy alignment with cross cutting objectives or with a reference text. Second, assessment of progress in implementation capacity requires gauging evolution towards predefined capacity needs or identified governance gaps. Third, evaluation of policy results requires clearly defined objectives, timelines and scales for assessments. Seven practical options are identified for applying these principles to agriculture and water policies, illustrated by ap...",

This report develops the hotspot approach, provides an application at the global scale, and presents a mitigation policy action plan. The People’s Republic of China, India and the United States are identified as countries facing the greatest water risks for agriculture production globally.A global simulation shows that, in the absence of action, water risks in Northeast China, Northwest India and the Southwest United States in particular could have significant production, price and trade consequences. Agriculture water risks could also result in broader socio-economic and food security concerns. Farmers, agro food companies, and governments can all play a role in responding to water risks at hotspot locations. A three-tier policy action plan is proposed to confront water risk hotspots, encompassing targeted respo...",

The list was first updated in June 2018 by the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/840 and in August 2020 by Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2020/1161. The period of continuous monitoring for any WL substance should not exceed four years (Article 8b of the EQSD). Thus, in 2022 the three substances added in 2018, i.e. the insecticide metaflumizone and the antibiotics amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin, should be removed. A maximum total of thirteen substances or groups of substances may be listed in the 4th WL, i.e. one more than the maximum allowed in 2020. The six substances or groups of substances added during the third WL update (EU 2020/1161) should be carried over to the 4th WL to ensure that enough high-quality monitoring data are collected for their risk assessment.

While significant efforts are being made across Africa to ensure better access and services, many places still have inadequate infrastructure for sanitation and wastewater management. This is happening at a time of greater need due to population growth, rapid urbanization, improving lifestyles, and industrial and agricultural expansion – all in a region that has low resilience to climate change.",

            "snippet" : "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is defined as the ability of microorganisms to withstand the effects of antibiotics. It is considered to be a universal threat to humans, animals and the environment. The resistance mechanisms developed by bacteria originate from the overuse of antibiotics in medical care and animal farming, or from the spread of resistance genes among microorganisms. Worldwide, 700 000 people die annually from resistant infections. Therefore, unless action is taken, the estimated annual deaths attributable to AMR will be 10 million by 2050. The aim of this report is to discuss the mechanisms of antibiotic action and antibiotic resistance, focusing on potential effects in water. Waterbodies have been recognised as a significant reservoir of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARG). They facilitate the interchange of resistance genes between pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria and may contribute to the maintenance of antimicrobial resistance in the environment. In this report, a re...",

Sewage treatment is an essential service that can deliver clean water, nutrients and organic fertiliser. It can and should contribute to delivering the broad goals of the Green Deal, with a key role in supporting the ambition to achieve zero pollution. Reviews and evaluations of key parts of European legislation, such as the Urban Waste Water Treatment and the Sewage Sludge Directives, present the opportunity to modernise and improve coherency across the sector. While recognising the broad scope of sewage treatment, it must be appreciated that the primary priority is to protect human health and the environment from the harm caused by insufficiently-treated sewage. This report focuses on water management, but action is needed in other sectors to support this area in achieving the ambition...",

The SSD aims at encouraging and ensuring the correct use of sewage sludge in agriculture. It regulates sludge use with an objective of preventing harmful effect on soil, waters, vegetation, animals, and humans. The main objective of the Directive is the protection of environment and human health. The Directive prohibits the use of untreated sludge on agricultural land unless it is injected or incorporated into the soil, it also requires that sludge is used in such a way that the nutrient requirements of plants and that the quality of the soil and of surface and groundwater is not impaired. In the past 34 years, there have been changes on the understanding of sewage sludge, the risks, and opportunities its use presents, but also in the wider environmental legislative framework that justify an in-depth evaluation of the Directive.",

            "snippet" : "Estimation of domestic and industrial emissions to the European fresh and marine waters is needed for assessing current ecological status of water bodies and providing inputs to conceptual models of pollutant transport and fate. Regulatory efforts of the European Commission, particularly Urban Waste Water Directive (UWWWD) and Water Framework Directive (WFD) prompted investments in waste treatment, and as a result point source emissions to water bodies have declined. In order to account for these improvements, domestic and industrial emission assessments were to be updated for conditions valid in the 2010s. The aim of this study was to assess the quantity and location of domestic and industrial waste emissions of pollutants in European waters for the 2010s. Specifically, the pollutants considered in this study were total Nitrogen (N), total Phosphorous (P), and organic pollution as measured by 5-days Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). The spatial resolution and extent of the analysis corresponded to the CCM2 River and Catchment Database for Europe. Pollutants were estimated in terms of mean annual average load (t/y) released in the CCM2 catchments. The reference period for the assessment was set to 2014-2015, although in some cases a longer time period was considered. The assessment of pollutant loads to waters from domestic and industrial emissions made full use of available European databases created in response to EU regulations. A method was developed to exploit the European datasets and fill in content gaps through alternative sources of information (REP approach). The European datasets allowed pinpointing waste emissions to a much higher spatial and conceptual resolution than before, although some knowledge gaps remained, affecting especially emissions from domestic waste of isolated dwellings, small agglomerations, and industries. Outside EU28, Switzerland and Norway, domestic and industrial emissions were assessed based on population density and national statistics of shares of population served by sewerage treatment and level of WWTP treatments (POP approach). The comparison between Population Equivalent generated in agglomerations and reported in the UWWTD database with country resident population allowed estimating an equivalence of 1.23 PE per inhabitant, meaning that on average in Europe the contribution of small industries, commercial activities and tourism can be considered about 23% of generated load. This information was used to assess population unreported in the UWWTD database because belonging to small isolated dwellings. Estimates of total emissions due to domestic waste with REP approach with those from POP approach for 30 countries covered by both methods were in good agreement, with Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.95 for Nitrogen, 0.94 for Phosphorous and 0.71 for BOD. Yet, important differences emerged when separating emissions by treatment type or pathway, e.g. looking at disconnected, connected not treated or connected and treated shares of domestic waste. The comparison highlighted inconsistencies between the European database and national statistics and it was noted that for some countries national statistics were scant or inconsistent. Thus, while total emissions are comparable, care should be taken when considering each population share independently. Finally, total pollutant emissions for Europe in 2010s were obtained by merging all available data, using the REP approach and the POP approach estimates to fill in knowledge gaps. In EU28, annual emissions to water from domestic and industrial waste for the 2010s were estimated at 777.6 kt/y of Nitrogen, 126.6 kt/y of Phosphorous and 2,190 kt/y of BOD. The majority of domestic waste is treated in WWTPs, with high adoption rates of tertiary treatment and Phosphorus removal technology, lowering emissions of domestic waste per capita. EU28 IND emissions accounted for 11.3% of N, 6.7% of P and 33.7% of BOD emissions. Emissions from population disconnected to sewerage systems or treated with IAS (for which only primary treatment was assumed) accounted for 11.2% of Nitrogen, 14.6% of Phosphorous and 19.5% BOD emissions to the environment. However only a part of these emissions would eventually reach freshwater systems, as environmental abatement (not considered in this study) would further reduce them. Conversely, connected not treated population contributed 6.2% of Nitrogen, 7.2% of Phosphorous, and 14.4% of BOD directly discharged to freshwater bodies. Tackling these sources of domestic waste and upgrading primary treatment facilities may further reduce pollution loads discharged in freshwater systems and ultimately to the seas.",

More specifically, the paper begins with an overview of the main biodiversity and health impacts of excess pesticide and fertiliser. In economic terms, nitrogen pollution, for example, has been estimated to cost the European Union between EUR 70 billion and EUR 320 billion per year. The paper also provides an overview of the trends in both pesticide sales (per 1000 ha of agricultural land area), and pesticide use (in tonnes of active ingredients), as well as soil nutrient balances in OECD countries before reviewing policy instruments available to promote more sustainable fertiliser and pesticide use. Case studies of specific policy responses used to address adverse impacts of pesticides including in Denmark and France are presented along with case studies of policies to counter nutrient pollution in Denmark, Japan and the United States.

At the same time, the global water cycle is intensifying due to climate change, with wetter regions generally becoming wetter and drier regions becoming even drier. Other global changes (e.g., urbanisation, deforestation, intensification of agriculture) add to these challenges.

During that update, the insecticide metaflumizone and the antibiotics amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin were added to the list. The purpose of this report is to propose candidate substances for the 3rd WL. Three pillars of information were used to select the candidate substances. The first pillar is the outcome of the last prioritisation exercise, the second includes the outcome of the review of the 1st WL and recommendations for the 3rd WL, and the third is based on a literature search and/or other sources (for instance information from Member States). The selection of candidate substances took into consideration their hazard properties as well as the availability of reliable safety thresholds (including the contribution to antimicrobial resistance for antibiotics) and the availability of relevant analytical methods f...",

Proporciona orientações para o avanço da implementação da cobrança no País como instrumento econômico e financeiro de gestão, visando prevenir e responder a situações de conflito pelo uso da água e de poluição, contribuindo para a segurança hídrica, e, consequentemente, favorecendo o crescimento econômico e o bem-estar social. O relatório evidencia a necessidade de informações, a aproximação da cobrança ao planejamento da bacia e a aplicação eficiente dos recursos arrecadados. O relatório inclui uma avaliação de três estudos de caso: o Estado do Rio de Janeiro, a Bacia do rio Paraíba do Sul e a Bacia do rio Piancó-Piranhas-Açu. Conclui com um plano de ação com etapas de implementação prática e delimitação de funções: quem pode fazer o quê para implementar as recomendações a curto, médio e longo prazo.",

The study also provides an overview of the developments at EU level and has a special focus on the role of parliaments in implementing Agenda 2030. Our analysis shows that EU Member States are integrating SDGs into national strategies. While Member States have taken steps to enhance horizontal policy coordination, there is a continuing need for better mainstreaming sustainability. Member States innovate with SDG budgeting, science-policy interface, and stakeholder participation mechanisms for making these strategies more operational.

The resistance mechanisms developed by bacteria originate from either the overuse of antibiotics in medical care and animal farming or from the spread of resistant genes among microorganisms. Worldwide, 700.000 people die annually from resistant infections and this means that if no action is taken, the estimated annual deaths attributable to AMR will be 10 million by 2050. The aim of this report is to discuss the mechanisms of antibiotic action and antibiotic resistance focusing on potential effects in water. Waterbodies have been indeed recognised as a significant reservoir of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARG). They contribute to the interchange of resistance genes between pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria and they may favour the maintenance of the resistance in the environment. In this repor...",

While significant efforts are being made across Africa to ensure better access and services, many places still have inadequate infrastructure for sanitation and wastewater management. This is happening at a time of greater need due to population growth, rapid urbanization, improving lifestyles, and industrial and agricultural expansion – all in a region that has low resilience to climate change. This atlas – a joint effort by the African Development Bank, the United Nations Environment Programme, and GRID-Arendal – profiles the state and trends in wastewater management and sanitation delivery in Africa; highlights the human health and ecosystem impacts of poor sanitation and wastewater management; and discusses the continent’s policy and institutional arrangements.

Regulatory efforts of the European Commission, particularly Urban Waste Water Directive (UWWTD) and Water Framework Directive (WFD) prompted investments in waste treatment, and as a result point source emissions to water bodies have declined. In order to account for these improvements, domestic and industrial emission assessments were to be updated for conditions valid in the 2010s. The aim of this study was to assess the quantity and location of domestic and industrial waste emissions of pollutants in European waters for the 2010s. Specifically, the pollutants considered in this study were total Nitrogen (N), total Phosphorous (P), and organic pollution as measured by 5-days Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). The spatial resolution and extent of the analysis corresponded to the CCM2...",

However, it can also contribute to carbon emissions and ecosystem degradation, while its reliance on freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems exposes it to the impacts of climate change. As the places where the blue economy takes place, creates value and provides jobs, cities and regions play a key role in unlocking the potential of a resilient blue economy that preserves the ecosystems that sustain it. Building on a global survey of 80+ cities, regions and basins, this report highlights the costs and benefits of the blue economy at subnational level, shedding light on the link between the blue economy and water security. This analysis provides an overview of the multi-level governance of the blue economy and related gaps. It calls on cities and regions to develop resilient, inclusive, sustainable and circular (RISC-proof) blue economies...",

It covers a broad range of water-related investments, including water and sanitation services, water resources management, agricultural water and managing water-related risks (“too much”, “too little” and “too polluted”). It summarises findings from analysis of investments needs and financing capacities, trends in development finance for water and explores how water risks generate financial impacts for corporates. The report highlights options to address the financing challenge by strengthening the enabling environment for investment, making the best use of existing sources of finance, strategic investment planning and mobilising additional finance via a range of financing approaches. Finally, the report sets out a vision for future OECD work on financing water and fo...",

Seven new substances could be added to the 5th WL if it is to contain the maximum allowed number of fourteen substances or groups of substances.The JRC defined three criteria for identifying substances for the 5th WL, and based on these criteria, seven substances or groups of substances were selected as most suitable candidates for the 5th WL.

The monograph system as defined in the literature, and two alternatives presented by Animal Health Europe and the European Group for Generic Veterinary Products were examined for their possible impacts, efficiency and effectiveness in achieving the objectives of Regulation (EU) 2019/06, i.e. reduce the administrative burden, enhance the internal market, increase the availability of VMPs, while guaranteeing the highest level of public and animal health and protection of the environment.

Irrigated agriculture remains by far the largest user of freshwater, but scarcity of freshwater is a growing problem owing to increasing demand and competition for freshwater resources. At the same time, rainfed agriculture is facing increasing precipitation variability driven by climate change. These trends will exacerbate disputes among water users and inequality in access to water, especially for small-scale farmers, the rural poor and other vulnerable populations.",

            "snippet" : "Knowledge of ecological and health risks of microplastic pollution is surrounded by considerable uncertainty. However, if microplastic pollution continues at the present rate, these risks will increase and, in particular, widespread ecological risks are likely in the coming decades. The absence of population-wide studies means that it is not yet possible to assess risks for human health. Ongoing and planned EU policy measures aim to reduce all plastic pollution including microplastics. But what more, if anything, should be done now as a precaution against future risks from microplastics? This scientific opinion, informed by a SAPEA evidence review report makes recommendations to advise debate, policy and practice in this and related areas. Highlights include calls to: • Broaden existing policy to prevent and reduce microplastic pollution in water, air, and soil; and to prioritise substance- and context-specific measures for high-volume, high-emission sources; • Ensure benefit to society of microplastic pollution preventative measures by taking into account socio-economic cost-benefit analyses, trade-offs and wide environmental aspects in the design of such measures; and • Develop a coordinated international response consisting of research collaboration (including filling knowledge gaps on nanoplastic pollution), data sharing and standards development for measurement, monitoring and risk assessment.",

The Regulation sets out minimum water quality and monitoring requirements, permitting and transparency provisions related to water reuse, as well as risk management requirements to ensure safe reuse of treated urban wastewater in agricultural irrigation. Annex II of the Regulation reports key elements to develop a Risk Management Plan. On this basis, considering world-wide established approaches (ISO 20426:2018, Australian Guidelines (2006), WHO Guidelines (2006, 2016)), and taking into account the European legal framework set out within the Water Framework Directive, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission developed the proposed technical guidelines for the application of the key risk management principles for the assessment and management of health and environmental ris...",

            "snippet" : "This report presents an assessment of European freshwater quantity and quality (nutrients), including and historical analysis (1990-2018) and future scenarios of measures to reduce water scarcity and nutrient pollution.The study was developed in the context of the project Blue2.2, which aims to support the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) and other water related EU strategies, by further developing and applying the JRC freshwater and marine modelling framework. The overall objective of the freshwater modelling is to assess the impacts of scenarios of measures and climate change on the freshwater environment on a pan European scale.Section 2 of the report describes the freshwater quantity and quality (nutrients) models developed and implemented by the JRC, complementing the marine models in the freshwater-marine modelling framework, including models parametrisation, calibration and validation, as well as references to scientific publications. Section 3 and Section 4 illustrate the historical data on water quantity and quality (1990-2018) estimated in the modelling and the construction of the scenarios of measures, respectively. Section 5 shows the results of the scenarios analysis, considering the specific effect of water quantity and quality measures, and coupled scenarios under future climate, with a specific focus on the difference between the Business As Usual and an High Ambition Scenario of measures implementation.",

Proporciona orientações para o avanço da implementação da cobrança no País como instrumento econômico e financeiro de gestão, visando prevenir e responder a situações de conflito pelo uso da água e de poluição, contribuindo para a segurança hídrica, e, consequentemente, favorecendo o crescimento econômico e o bem-estar social. O relatório evidencia a necessidade de informações, a aproximação da cobrança ao planejamento da bacia e a aplicação eficiente dos recursos arrecadados. O relatório inclui uma avaliação de três estudos de caso: o Estado do Rio de Janeiro, a Bacia do rio Paraíba do Sul e a Bacia do rio Piancó-Piranhas-Açu. Conclui com um plano de ação com etapas de implementação prática e delimitação de funções: quem pode fazer o quê para implementar as recomendações a curto, médio e longo prazo.",

The main questions addressed in this report are: - To what extent are the main pollutants released by urban areas collected and treated? - What have been the (quantitative and qualitative) effects of the UWWTD? In order to answer these questions, we have considered past (pre-Directive) and present (baseline) conditions of wastewater treatment in Europe, and we have compared these with scenarios of full compliance with the Directive and a hypothetic evolution of the pre-Directive situation in the absence of the UWWTD. Under each of these scenarios, we have used models to estimate loads and concentrations of contaminants in order to appraise the effects of the Directive on the status of European waters.",

The monograph system as defined in the literature, and two alternatives presented by Animal Health Europe and the European Group for Generic Veterinary Products were examined for their possible impacts, efficiency and effectiveness in achieving the objectives of Regulation (EU) 2019/06, i.e. reduce the administrative burden, enhance the internal market, increase the availability of VMPs, while guaranteeing the highest level of public and animal health and protection of the environment.

Sewage treatment is an essential service that can deliver clean water, nutrients and organic fertiliser. It can and should contribute to delivering the broad goals of the Green Deal, with a key role in supporting the ambition to achieve zero pollution. Reviews and evaluations of key parts of European legislation, such as the Urban Waste Water Treatment and the Sewage Sludge Directives, present the opportunity to modernise and improve coherency across the sector. While recognising the broad scope of sewage treatment, it must be appreciated that the primary priority is to protect human health and the environment from the harm caused by insufficiently-treated sewage.

The increasing pressure caused by urbanisation, industrialisation, population growth and climate change in Korea has led to more land consumption and augmented water supply, at the expense of the environment and at a high cost for public finance. Korea has engaged with the OECD via a national policy dialogue to explore best practices from the wider international community to better manage the nexus at the river basin scale.",

For each scenario, we analyse the possible implications for key water management issues (wastewater treatment, diffuse pollution and hydromorphological alteration). Based on this analysis, we identify possible no-regret actions to adopt in the Danube region in order to improve water management in the long-term, along the three main lines:1) Developing effective communities.2) Basin-wide integration of the management of certain issues.3) Bringing nature protection to the core of strategies.Sharing and strengthening capacity at various levels of water management is a precondition to avoid marginalization and impoverishment of regions within the Danube.

The JRC models are evaluated with historical data on water quantity and quality (1990-2018). Two scenarios under future climate (2020-2030) consider the Business As Usual (BAU) and a High Ambition Scenario (HAS) of measures implementation. The scenario analysis shows that investments planned in BAU are insufficient to compensate for the projected reduction in water availability. The additional measures in HAS might alleviate water scarcity in the Mediterranean countries, but only when desalination is considered. Depending on how fast the global temperature will rise, there might still be time to invest in water saving measures to keep up with the decreasing water availability caused by global warming. With regard to water quality, measures tackling different sectors and sources (domestic wastewater, air emissions, agriculture) are necessary to redu...",

The environmental domains in the PINE database support tracking progress towards domestic and international environmental objectives.

With a rapidly growing global population, demand for water is expected to increase by nearly one-third by 2050. In the face of accelerated consumption, increasing environmental degradation and the multi-faceted impacts of climate change, we clearly need new ways to manage competing demands on our precious freshwater resources. The 2018 edition of the UN World Water Development Report (WWDR2018) suggests that solutions may be closer than we think. For too long, the world has turned first to human-built, or “grey”, infrastructure to improve water management. In so doing, it has often brushed aside traditional and Indigenous knowledge that embraces greener approaches. Three years into the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it is time for us to re-examine nature-based solutions (NBS) to help achieve water management objectives. The WWDR2018 illustrates that working with natur...",

This report summarises for the first time the status of air, climate, water and soil in the Western Balkans (WB), describing current knowledge as of 2021 and gaps with respect to the EU aquis in order to: a) benchmark the progress during the accession process, and b) support the implementation of the Green Agenda for the WB with particular reference to depollution and decarbonisation priorities. This information is also relevant for the EU Green Deal zero pollution ambition, as depollution in WB also reduces pollutant levels in neighbouring EU Member States. Despite significant improvements in the alignment of the climate and GHG emissions monitoring and reporting legislation and the good progress in the areas of air and water pollution in the latest two years, the EU aquis implementation is still lagging. The overall WB air quality situation is still critical and the pollution trend is often up...",

It showed that WES is not only a cost- effective way to detect epidemic outbreaks early but it is also essential for tracking the spread of global pathogens, which can help with resource mobilization and targeted interventions. The European Health Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA), along with international partners, are leading efforts to establish a global consortium for WES. The aim is to improve coordination and adaptability to technological advances. The EU Wastewater Observatory for Public Health has been launched, demonstrating a commitment to integrating WES into policy. This is endorsed by the EU4Health 2024 Work Programme, which mandates wastewater testing to boost preparedness against cross-border health threats. This initiative aligns with the EU's objective of strengthening health system responsiveness and coordination amon...",

It ensures technical assistance in the implementation of the key elements of risk management set out in Annex II of the regulation. In addition an overview of the current EU progress on water reuse in the European Union, of the Water Reuse Regulations and the principal approaches and guidelines for risk management in water reuse system is shown. The reader finds a recommended approach to develop a Risk Management Plan for a water reuse system as well as a a series of case studies of water reuse systems from several EU Member States (MS) that were presented during a series of Technical Workshops on Risk Management for Agricultural Irrigation in Europe, organized by JRC between May and November 2021.",

In an ever-changing economic and policy environment, the EU agro-food system has demonstrated its resilience and the ability to keep productivity growing. More needs to be done for the agricultural sector to improve its environmental sustainability performance in line with expectations.Policies for the Future of Farming and Food in the European Union applies the OECD Productivity, Sustainability and Resilience (PSR) analytical framework along with the latest data from the OECD Agri-Environmental Indicators to benchmark the sustainable productivity performance of the EU’s agricultural sector and to identify the main challenges ahead. The EU´s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is called to play an important role in implementing the European Green Deal’s vision and objectives. Responding to pressing environmental concerns will require redesigning CAP payments, addressing the implementation gap on sustainability, implementing an ambitiou...",

These include investments needed to comply with EU regulation for water supply, wastewater collection and treatment, and flood protection.As part of the research, new data was produced on current levels of expenditure for water supply, sanitation and flood protection, as well as on projected needs. It supported a comparison across member states and substantiated tailored policy discussions in selected countries and at European level. This report captures the rationale for the research, the main quantitative outcomes and the policy issues and recommendations that derived from this two-year co-operation. Lessons from Europe outlined in this report can inspire similar research and policy discussions in other parts of the world.",

It provides an overview of economic policy instruments to address water scarcity and manage water demand. Additionally, the paper explores policy options and considerations for addressing water scarcity and meeting Water Framework Directive (WFD) objectives. These considerations include balancing demand management and supply augmentation, managing water scarcity through robust allocation regimes, and increasing the use of agro-environmental measures and practices. The paper also discusses the principles and features of effective allocation regimes, drivers and incentives for allocation reforms, the hierarchy and sequencing of water use, abstraction charges, ensuring return flows and ecological flows, and improving the coherence of WFD measures and climate change policies. This is the third in a sub-set of four working papers within the Environment Working Paper series destin...",

Le Chili est bien placé pour atteindre ses objectifs en matière de biodiversité, tandis que la pollution de l’air reste un sérieux problème de santé publique et que la gestion des déchets repose largement sur la mise en décharge.

            "snippet" : "Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are contaminants of emerging environmental and health concern that have been detected in freshwater, wastewater and drinking water. They interfere with the endocrine system in humans and wildlife, and produce adverse effects such as developmental, reproductive, neurological and immune effects. Their presence in water raises concerns for the integrity of ecosystems and biodiversity. Addressing the challenges of EDCs in water is particularly complex due to their ability to trigger adverse effects at very low concentrations, their potency in mixtures with other chemicals, and the vast range of sources and entryways of this group of chemicals into the environment. This report presents new water quality monitoring methods, such as bioassays and non-targeted analysis, that are well equipped to capture the impacts of EDCs in water. These new methods supplement the traditional substance-by-substance chemical analysis of water quality. The report also outlines policy instrument...",

            "snippet" : "After decades of regulation and investment to reduce point source water pollution, OECD countries still face water quality challenges (e.g. eutrophication) from diffuse agricultural and urban sources of pollution, that is disperse pollution from surface runoff, soil filtration and atmospheric deposition. The relative lack of progress reflects the complexities of controlling multiple pollutants from multiple sources, their high spatial and temporal variability, associated transactions costs, and limited political acceptability of regulatory measures. This report outlines the water quality challenges facing OECD countries today, presents a range of policy instruments and innovative case studies of diffuse pollution control, and concludes with an integrated policy framework to tackle diffuse water pollution. An optimal approach will likely entail a mix of policy interventions reflecting the basic OECD principles of water quality management – pollution prevention, treatment at source, the polluter pays and b...",

The aim is to provide accurate and complete environmental information to monitor the progress in the accession process, as well as to support the implementation of the Green Agenda for the WB with particular reference to depollution and decarbonisation pillars and more general to support environmental management. In this edition, particular emphasis is made on the impacts of climate change on hydrological aspects (rainfall, droughts, surface and groundwater), forest fires and heat waves. This information is also relevant for the EU Green Deal zero pollution ambition, since the depollution in WB economies is expected to reduce the transboundary pollution in neighbouring and in other EU Member States as well. There has been evident progress in the alignment with EU acquis on environment and climate, however, its implementation is still slow and insufficient. ...",

Ce rapport vise à fournir un ensemble dinformations suffisamment détaillées afin de permettre la mise en place dune surveillance des eaux usées pour lARN du SRAS- CoV-2. Utilité :  La surveillance du SRAS-CoV-2 dans les eaux usées est un outil complémentaire et indépendant.  Dans un contexte de prévalence élevée, la surveillance du SRAS-CoV-2 dans les eaux usées comme outil dalerte précoce est difficile et exige une grande résolution du signal. Il est recommandé deffectuer des études interlaboratoires pour déterminer des pratiques et des procédures dAQ/CQ communes. Il existe des lacunes dans la communication entre les disciplines concernées.  Des niveaux élevés de variabilité dans les signaux quantitatifs du virus du SRAS-CoV- 2 sont observés au sein dun même site et entre les sites.  Le rapport souligne également la possibilité dutiliser une plateforme de surveillance à partir des eaux usées conçue pour la COVID-19 pour dautres types de biomarqueurs. https://rsc-src.ca/en/covid-19-policy-briefing/wastewater-surveillance-for-sars-cov-2-rna-in-canada",
